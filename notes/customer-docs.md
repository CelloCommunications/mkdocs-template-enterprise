# Customer Docs

Requested by: @dbendersky

## Concept

Sharing Private Documentation with Customers

Like so:

 - <https://customer1.docs.cello.co.nz>
 - <https://customer2.docs.cello.co.nz>

Internal Docs will still live at:

 - <https://docs.cello.co.nz>

The idea is that we will have customers with whom we have to:

 - publish formal documentation
 - collaborate on docs
 - allow customer's to edit, or propose revisions to formal docs
 - securely access formal docs
 - have access to the docs we create that describe their environment

## Requests

>Ideally our customer.docs system would:

- use subdomains
- have auth system
- keeps the source data/repo held privately
- restricts access to the web server unless customer has auth'd or comes from their WAN IP (not sure about the latter)
- Allows customers to submit issues or bugs etc and let us fix or merge their fix
