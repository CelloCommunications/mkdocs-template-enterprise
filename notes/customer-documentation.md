# Sharing Private Documentation with Customers i.e. 
 - https://customer1.docs.cello.co.nz
 - https://customer2.docs.cello.co.nz

# Internal Docs will still live at
 - https://docs.cello.co.nz

# Here the idea is that we will have customers with whom we have to 
 - publish formal documenation 
 - collaborate on docs
 - allow customer's to edit, or propose revisions to formal docs
 - securely access formal docs
 - have access to the docs we create that describe their environment

# Ideally our customer.docs system 
- uses subdomains 
- can have auth systems or plugins
- keeps the source data/repo held privately
- restricts access to the web server unless customer has auth'd or comes from their WAN IP (not sure about the latter)
- Allows customers to submit issues or bugs etc and let us fix or merge their fix
